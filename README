Version
=======

Tracks changes on an object through time, no more, no less. Each time a versioned
object has validated and is about to save, the changes provided by 
ActiveRecord::Dirty are stored for later use. Procs may be used to customize the
stored value of each field, allowing diffs or other compress version formats to
be plugged right in.


Example
=======

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base 

	acts_as_versioned

end


person = Person.new
person.versions.count # => 0

person.update_attribute(:name_first, "Cookie Monster")

person.versions.count # => 1
person.versions # => [{:name_first => [nil, "Cookie Monster"]}]
